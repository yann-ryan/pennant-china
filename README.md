# pennant-china
The repository contains the code used to create the 'Mapio Pennant yn Tsieina', an interactive map of volume 17 of Thomas Pennant's 'Outlines of the Globe', which focuses on Japan and China. 

The code here processes the original Recogito annotations and turns them into a series of leaflet maps, using the {flexdashboard} package. 

The repository contains the script for downloading and transforming the annotations file, plus the markdown for the dashboard.
