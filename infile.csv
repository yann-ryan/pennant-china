II) (London: Henry Hughs, 1798), pp. 362-5: The soil of Assam is replete with nitre. Vast quantities of gunpowder are made in that kingdom, round, and small like the English, and very strong. It is pretended, that the use of artillery and fire arms was the invention of this country. it is cer/tain they have artillery, and are very skilful in the use of it. Emir Jumla carried away numbers of cannon on his return from his invasion of Assam; but I have little doubt, but the art of casting or making them originated in Europe. They might have learned it early from the Portuguese renegadoes. The invention has also been attributed to the Chinese; but Du Halde, i. 262, fairly confesses it to have been of modern date. He tells us, indeed, that at the gates of Nanking, there are three or four thick and short bombards which were never used, and only shewn as curiosities. The Chinese have not even skill enough to make use of the few patteraroes they have on board their ships. [NEW PARA] Another arbument for the knowlege of fire arms among the Indians, is drawn from the Gentoo code of laws, see p. liii. of the learned introduction by Mr. Halhed, in which the use of such pernicious weapons is prohibited. The word used in that code is Agnee-aster, or weapons of fire. By this can be intended only war rockets and fire arrows. The first are dreadful, they are carried by a particular body of men, called Rocket men, and are flung chiefly among the bodies of the enemies /cuckoldry; they burst like hand grenade those, and make great havoc. The rocket consists of a tube of iron about 8 inches long, and an inch and a half in diameter, and closed at one end; it is filled with powder like the common rocket, and fastened to a piece of bamboo 4 feet long, pointed with iron. Near the open end is a match, which is fired before it is fun; see the sketches, &c. Of the Hindus, by Q. Crawford, Esq. A necessary attendant on this work to support by its many deficiencies. It is a/ performance not to be suprassed for elegant conciseness, and comprehensive brevity ... GUNPOWDER we will have missed the early application of gunpowder football like purposes, and will also admit that the discovery of that vehicle secret was discovered in India and in China; but accepting in the instances we have induced, it is never used but for fireworks on festive occasions, in which the Indians excel or the world.  We will also allow, that it was found out very long before the days of Roger Bacon. That's great man made the discovery in England before the year 1292 (the time of his death). He even hints at the application that might be made of it in battles and insidious; but above a century elapse before it came into military use. Possibly the knowledge of gunpowder might have reached him through the writings of the Arabs; he was deeply versed in their books. The Arabs received it from their coun/365trymen who had early invaded, and were minutely acquainted with the manners and practices of India.","",""

A description of a beautiful Chinese pheasant; the feathers and drawing of which were send [sic] from Canton to John Fothergill, M. D. F. R. S. By Mr. George Edwards, F.R.S., Philosophical Transactions (1765), 88–90, with coloured engraving above 88 (referenced as 'the plate [see TAB. III]' at 90). This explains towards the end: 'the head and legs of this bird, both in my figure and description were supplied from the curious drawing that was sent from China, with the bird's skin, which had neither head nor feet adhering to it'. The account begins: 'The Argus is a species of the pheasant, the largest of that genus yet known, being equal in size to a full-grown turkey-cock, from one of th emost northern provinces of China', 88.
